## Summary

As I approach the end of my Machine Learning course at UT Dallas, I reflect on the various projects that I completed. I enjoyed learning the R programming language and exploring how suitable it is for machine learning purposes. I am glad that I was able to utilize my python skills to complete some of the projects. I was able to learn about different python libraries like sklearn and see how they help with machine learning purposes.

I will continue to explore the ever-changing machine learning space with curiosity and will bring my newfound machine learning skills with me into the professional world.
